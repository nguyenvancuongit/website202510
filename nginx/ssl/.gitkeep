# SSL Certificate placeholder
# Replace with your actual SSL certificate in production

# To generate a self-signed certificate for development:
# openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 \
#   -keyout nginx/ssl/key.pem \
#   -out nginx/ssl/cert.pem \
#   -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/CN=localhost"

# For production, use certificates from Let's Encrypt or a CA
